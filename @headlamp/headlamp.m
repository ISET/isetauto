classdef headlamp < handle
    %HEADLAMP Specialized class of light
    %   for simulating vehicle headlamps (aka headlights)
    
    % We model them using projection lights.
    % That gives us an RGB "mask" image that is projected onto the FOV of the
    % light. The class generates those as needed, but for remote resource
    % execution we need to copy them to /Resources/skymaps.

    % Masks either have a simple cutoff angle and power multiplier below that
    % cutoff, or can optionally have an additional distance-based
    % attenuation so that the headlight sends less energy to areas of the
    % road that are closer to the vehicle. Currently, attenuation is
    % supported for the Level Beam preset.
    
    properties

        location = [0 0 0];
        orientation = [0 0 0];
        name;

        resolution = [512 1024]; % assume wider than tall 

        peakIntensity = 61500; % candelas at a nominal bright point

        % Having trouble seeing where light projects
        % so try cutting from 80/20 to 20/10
        horizontalFOV = 40; % apparently +/- 40 is fairly standard
        verticalFOV; % set in creation function
        cutOffAngle = -.5; % matches headlight calibration
        power = 5; % for level beams with .8 mask, pretty good match

        % Calculated depending on the preset used
        lightMask;
        lightMaskFileName = ''; % where we put our mask for iset/pbrt to use

    %% Equations:
    %{
        Amount of light on an illuminated surface
        Lux = Candela/meter^2
        Candela = meter^2 * Lux

        NOTE: Vertical is angle from beam center, not from ground
        groundDistance = height / -1 * tan(angle['vertical'])
        hypotenuseDistance = height / -1 * sin(angle['vertical')

        Chart here: https://blog.betterautomotivelighting.com/high-quality-low-beam-distribution
        to map beam intensity spread. Still working it out.
        It definitely shows light intensity falloff based on beam angle.
        Which then needs to be divided by the surface area.

        An optimized light distribution is in:
        Generic Headlamp Light Distribution

        In theory we can use that to generate a "mask"
