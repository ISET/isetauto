# Neural Networks Generalization Across Different Cameras
Testing how neural networks perform when data are collected using different cameras

## Directory structure

* Parameters - stores files describing different aspects of the camera, for 
example lens descriptions.
* Code/Rendering - Matlab code that uses RTB4 to render images of cars in
urban environments

## Network environment

Tensorflow

## Collection of networks tested

Yolo, SSD, ...

## Camera models tested
