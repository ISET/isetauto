# ISETAUTO

We hope to learn how well machine-learning algorithms (mainly convolutional networks) generalize for different types of cameras.  The camera variations include lenses, CFAs and other design possibilities.

This repository includes the code in various papers that produced realistic driving scenes and a variety of camera designs.  We use the data from multiple camera designs to evaluate how well trained object detection networks generalize across camera designs.

We expect (hope) that over time, the repository will contain the analyses from multiple papers on this topic.  

## Dependencies
The code in this repository depends on the isetcam, iset3d and isetcloud repositories, including both the PBRT methods and the Tensorflow methods.
